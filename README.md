### 🚀 About Me

I'm a **Frontend Developer** based in Vienna, Austria 🇦🇹, passionate about creating **accessible, user-focused and performant** digital experiences.

With a background in Web Design & Development (SAE Institute) and 7+ years of experience at **XXXLdigital**, I bridge the gap between design and engineering — building scalable, performant, and visually engaging web apps.

I love working with:
- ⚛️ **React & Next.js**
- 🧠 **TypeScript**
- 🎨 **SCSS / CSS Modules**
- ♿ **Accessibility (a11y)**
- 💡 **UI/UX & Interaction Design**

### 🧩 My Development Philosophy

> “Good interfaces disappear — great ones empower.”  

My approach combines technical precision with a strong design sense.
I care deeply about **performance, accessibility, and maintainability** — not just shipping fast, but shipping right.
